# Conclusion

After conducting our thorough research, we have landed on these specific recommendations. We found there are high seasonal trends where late summer/early fall tends to have the worst air quality. These numbers consistently show up each year, exasperated by the dry heat and lack of rainfall. As climate change raises temperatures and water sources dry up, wildfire season will continue to get worse over time. We must be aware of the nature of air quality and how it differs at different parts of the year. We should understand how the AQI works, and avoid being outside for too long when it reaches more dangerous levels.

Air quality is significantly affected by various natural and unpredictable elements, including:

- Weather conditions
- Wind speed and direction
- Temperature fluctuations
- Humidity levels
- Atmospheric pressure
- Solar radiation intensity

With multiple factors we have no control over, it is important to do what we can for those factors we can impact.

We must focus on the variables that have the greatest impact on the AQI. These are city, temperature, humidity, CO, NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5. City, temperature, and humidity for the most part are out of our control. That leaves us with three criteria gasses and all particulate matter. The largest source of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone is the cars, trucks, and other vehicles we use daily (Environmental Protection Agency). We can lower our reliance on personal vehicles by utilizing public transportation, carpooling, walking, biking, increasing work from home to lower commutes when available, and overall be more considerate about if driving a car is necessary. We often drive unnecessarily, out of convenience or impatience. 

For many Americans, personal vehicles are required. Many urban and suburban areas lack proper public transportation, or existing public transportation systems are inadequate, unreliable, and infrequent. Many towns and cities in the United States were designed for cars instead of for people. Fixing this will require a substantial overhaul, necessitating millions or billions of dollars in spending. This is not to say that we shouldn’t bother---any investment that increases the public transportation system’s usage decreases the amount of cars on the road. A small change is the first step in addressing the personal vehicle issue.

Industrial manufacturing processes and agriculture are significant polluters of the environment. We should invest in the research of more environmentally friendly manufacturing methods, working with materials that require less combustion, or are recyclable. Agricultural reduction starts with less of a reliance on red meat and the dairy industry, mainstays of the American diet. This will be a huge shift, taking combined efforts of the citizens, government, and food industry. As red meat and dairy consumption goes down, possibly due to the replacement with artificial or lab grown meat, less livestock will need to be kept, and less feeding crops will need to be grown (Congressional Budget Office). It will be a difficult transition but a necessary one.

Wildfires not only increase the particle matter in the air, but burn forests, causing long term damage to the soil. Particulate matter in the air makes it more difficult to breathe, which is reflected by the increased AQI levels. Not all forest fires are started by man made sources, but many are. Therefore, when in the woods, one should always obey fire restrictions, especially in the middle of the summer when it’s most dry. If fires are allowed, they should always be watched and never left unattended. They must always be properly extinguished and all embers must be cool to the touch before leaving. Campsites should be properly cleaned, and all tools used correctly. One should also stay on marked trails, avoiding trampling vegetation which can increase the risk of wildfire spreading (Oregon Wildfire Response and Recovery).

One of the largest limitations is Algorithm Dependence. This is the reliability of forecasts which are inherently tied to the chosen predictive algorithms. Different models may yield varying results, emphasizing the importance of algorithm selection and validation.

We must also be wary of geographical considerations. Our data analysis couldn't fully quantify the unique geographical features of Portland and the broader Willamette Valley region. In further analysis we should seek to understand: 

- The protective influence of surrounding mountain ranges
- The impact on wind patterns and air circulation
- The potential effects of wildfires on air quality

These geographical factors play a significant role in local air quality dynamics but were beyond the scope of our current data set. The impact of the geological features can be seen in the image below (figure 1414)

By recognizing these limitations, we can better interpret and apply our forecasting results, while also identifying areas for future research and data collection to enhance prediction accuracy.

Ultimately, we have a responsibility to take care of our planet and combat climate change. The worse climate conditions get, the more wildfires will spread, and the worse the air quality will become. As time goes on, with worsening air conditions, more people will catch and even die from preventable conditions sparked by poor air quality.  Water, pollution, food, and financial problems will get worse. One should look at what they can do to make a difference, support those who vouch to make larger changes, and encourage people they know to do the same. While the situation may seem dire, there is hope for progress through concerted and informed efforts.
